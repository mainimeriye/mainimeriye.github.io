    <h1>MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT</h1>
The inception of this project began in the Spring of 2022 after completing <a class="link" href="https://politicaleducation.peoplesforum.org/revfem22student" target="_blank">Revolutionary Feminism: Theory and Practice</a>, a public and free course taught through The People’s Forum in NYC. Our final project was to create a resource that documented our learnings. My group and I created a <a class="link" href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ed80a2018b1370c9a4f48a9/t/624489c413ca6975e92822ba/1648658885221/RevFemZineFINAL030222_compressed.pdf" target="_blank">zine</a> for essential care workers. I left the course feeling inspired to learn more and expand the movement and community we were building in New York. I traveled to India after to celebrate my cousins’ weddings in Dehradun and Dharamshala, two beautiful and popular hill stations, and also luckily, my familial hometowns.
<br></br>
I had been feeling a push away from New York, and a pull towards India but until that specific trip, it hadn’t solidified. I returned from that trip re-energized and ready for a change. I changed jobs, and planned my project idea until I left for India on a one-way ticket in February of 2023.  I spent 6 months traveling around India, meeting economists, scholars, activists, entrepreneurs, and reading a lot of feminist scholarship. Once I solidified an idea based on their advice, I created a formal concept note to circulate, began my research, and the rest was truly the divine timing of perfect alignments. I have deep gratitude.

This project is grounded in Marxist feminist philosophy which expands labor relations to reproductive labor. Traditionally, this work is perceived as natural “feminine” duties encouraging a biological destiny for women in which love– rather than wages or money– is meant to serve as its own reward. This project sees housework as more than just housework. It is the servicing of waged workers emotionally, physically, and sexually. The labor of “love” includes but is not limited to pregnancy, childcare, daily cooking and cleaning, emotional support, and sex. Economically, the labor of “love” is the production and reproduction of labor power and human capital, or a person’s capacity to work. Silvia Federici, author of Wages Against Housework, writes that this perspective “is the only revolutionary perspective from a feminist viewpoint and ultimately for the entire working class.” 
<br></br>
In January of 2024, the Kickstarter Campaign launched to raise funds for the production budget. With the generous contributions of 51 different backers, and a few private donors, the campaign successfully raised nearly USD $10K. All of the funding went into the production of the project, including the artists, film production, printing, NGO partners, individual participants, and the community launch event.
<br></br>
Since the completion and launch in April 2024, thanks to all the support and admiration, the project has continued on…and hopefully will continue to grow and be shared around the world.
