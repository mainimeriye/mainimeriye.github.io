										<p>Mai Ni Meriye is a zine and short film containing content from interviews with 19 local women in Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh– a hill station town among the Himalayas in Northern India. The goal of the project is to draw attention to the aspects of labor within a traditional family structure, and to understand reproductive labor from the perspectives of women at the grassroots level.</p>

									<h2>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h2>
								</header>
								<p> What is the labor of “love?” That’s what this project aims to understand. The labor being investigated in this project is mostly regarded as housework or domestic work. Traditionally, this work is perceived as natural “feminine” duties encouraging a biological destiny for women in which love– rather than wages or money– is meant to serve as its own reward. This project sees housework as more than just housework. It is the servicing of waged workers emotionally, physically, and sexually. The labor of “love” includes but is not limited to pregnancy, childcare, daily cooking and cleaning, emotional support, and sex. Economically, the labor of “love” is the production and reproduction of labor power and human capital, or a person’s capacity to work.
									<br></br>
									The goal of this project is to understand the labor of “love” and the laborers of “love” to build class solidarity among women, anchored in their shared experiences as unwaged laborers. With more knowledge on the current understanding of women’s thoughts and feelings about this labor, we can work towards finding a just value for the labor (is it wages? Is it something other than wages?) and eventually find a way to use this labor as bargaining power against misogyny.  Without women and without their labor, the global economy would come to a halt. For a society that values capital, the societal treatment of women is a serious contradiction. Waged working women are not paid the same as their male counterparts. Abortions are still considered taboo, and illegal in parts of the world. Women are more likely to be victims of sexual violence. These are just a few examples. This project aims to understand these contradictions better-at a very local level and then bring this conversation to a larger audience. 
									<br></br>
									The larger goal is for the labor of “love” to be part of a wide range of conversations from small village discussions over tea, to mainstream platforms with influential voices- all in service of a new perspective on women and housework. 
									<br></br>

								<p>On April 8th, 2024, Mai Ni Meriye was shared with the local community members of Dharamshala. Each participant, the NGOs involved, the creators, local businesses, and friends and family were invited to view a screening of the film and receive the zines. The event was held at The Other Space cafe, a multicultural co-working space and cafe in the heart of the town. Overlooking the Himalayas, this cafe is home to many travelers, and creators. Together, all the people who made the project happen came together to celebrate and see the results of the work. Book and postcard displays were hand made at Dharamkot Studio. Local digital creator Pulkit Chaudhary and his team captured the event.
